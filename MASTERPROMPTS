  "input": {"topic": "your research area"},
  "expectedApproach": "Multi-source validation with synthesis"
}'
```

**For API Intelligence:**

```bash
# Complete API intelligence workflow
mcp-use api_intelligent_discover '{
  "apiDocumentationUrl": "api_docs_url",
  "userGoal": "what you want to accomplish",
  "autoSetup": true
}'

```

### **Cognitive Performance Optimization**

**Memory Management Best Practices:**

- Store insights with relevance scores: `memory_store(content, context, relevance: 0.8-1.0)`
- Retrieve contextually: `memory_retrieve(query, context, limit: 5-10)`
- Build knowledge graphs: `knowledge_create_entity` for permanent learning

**Quality Assurance Integration:**

- Apply constitutional assessment at decision points
- Use learning feedback for continuous improvement
- Monitor performance with `learning_metrics`

**Multi-Modal Processing Excellence:**

- Combine document processing with sequential thinking
- Use memory storage for cross-modal insights
- Apply knowledge creation for pattern recognition
