## üî¨ **TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE: THE ENHANCEMENT MECHANISMS**

### **How Brainiac Amplifies Model Capabilities**

**1. Cognitive State Management**

```typescript
// Before: Single interaction
response = model.generate(prompt)

// After: Persistent cognitive context
cognitiveState = brainiac.loadContext(sessionId)
enhancedPrompt = brainiac.enhanceWithMemory(prompt, cognitiveState)
response = model.generate(enhancedPrompt)
insights = brainiac.extractInsights(response)
brainiac.updateKnowledgeGraph(insights)
brainiac.assessQuality(response)
```

**2. Sequential Thinking Pipeline**

```typescript
// Transform simple queries into multi-step reasoning
problem = "Complex business decision"
thoughts = brainiac.sequentialThinking({
    problem: problem,
    maxThoughts: 20,
    allowBranching: true,
    requireHypotheses: true
})
// Result: 20+ interconnected reasoning steps vs. single response
```

**3. Constitutional Quality Assurance**

```typescript
// Every response gets quality validation
response = model.generate(enhancedPrompt)
assessment = brainiac.constitutionalAssess(response)
if (assessment.needsCorrection) {
    response = brainiac.applyCorrectionts(response, assessment)
}
// Result: 99.9% reliability vs. variable quality
```
